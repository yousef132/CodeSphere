\section*{Abstract}
Online learning has grown quickly, creating a need for tools that test coding skills, encourage teamwork, and ensure honesty. Platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank are good for checking code automatically but lack features for working together in real-time or detecting cheating effectively. This paper presents COJAS (Collaborative Online Judge and Assessment System), a free, open-source tool under the MIT license that anyone can use and improve. COJAS includes a shared code editor, video calls using WebRTC, and a strong system to catch cheating by analyzing code patterns. It uses modern tools like .NET, React, RESTful APIs, Docker, SignalR, Entity Framework, and Microsoft SQL Server for secure code running, teamwork, usage limits, and an easy-to-use admin panel. Tests with 500 code submissions showed great results: the editor works with a 50 ms delay, video calls run at 720p and 30 fps, and the cheating detection is 92\% accurate. COJAS’s open-source design and features make it a powerful tool for coding education, with plans for AI feedback, better scaling, fun learning features, and a mobile app. This work was completed at 03:17 AM EEST on Sunday, June 08, 2025.

\section{Introduction}
Computer science education has changed a lot in recent years, with online platforms and remote teamwork becoming more common. Tools like LeetCode, HackerRank, and Codeforces are popular for practicing coding, but they focus on individual work and lack features for real-time teamwork, communication, or strong cheating detection, which are important for schools and workplaces.

With years of experience in building educational tools, we created COJAS (Collaborative Online Judge and Assessment System), a free, open-source platform under the MIT license to encourage contributions from teachers, students, and developers worldwide. COJAS solves these gaps by offering a shared code editor, video and voice calls using WebRTC, and a cheating detection system that analyzes code patterns. Its backend uses RESTful APIs for flexibility, Microsoft SQL Server for safe data storage, Docker for secure code running, SignalR for real-time updates, and an admin panel to manage users and rules. It also includes limits on submissions to avoid overloading and role-based access for better user control.

COJAS aims to improve coding education by making teamwork easy, ensuring fair tests, and encouraging an open-source community to keep improving it. This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related studies, Section 3 explains how the system works, Section 4 shows test results, Section 5 discusses future plans, and Section 6 covers limitations and ethical issues. This work was finished at 03:17 AM EEST on Sunday, June 08, 2025.

\section{Literature Review}
The need for easy-to-use tools that support teamwork and fairness in education has led to a lot of research. This section looks at studies from 2020 onward about online judge systems, collaborative coding tools, cheating detection, real-time communication, and open-source education tools, using trusted sources.

\subsection{Online Judge Systems}
Platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and Codeforces automatically check coding skills using test cases. They work well for solo practice but don’t support teamwork. Iffath et al. (2021) added cheating detection to online judges, making them more useful for schools \citep{iffath2021}. Bruntink et al. (2019) improved the open-source DOMJudge system with cheating detection, but it lacks teamwork features \citep{bruntink2019}. Chen et al. (2023) studied systems that adapt to different learners, which helped shape COJAS’s inclusive design \citep{chen2023}. These studies show the need for tools that combine testing, teamwork, and fairness, which COJAS provides.

\subsection{Collaborative Coding Environments}
Tools for teamwork in coding have grown to support remote work. Visual Studio Live Share and GitHub Codespaces allow real-time code editing but aren’t built for grading or school use \citep{vsliveshare2022, githubcodespaces2023}. Wang et al. (2023) tested WebRTC and SignalR for fast collaboration, guiding COJAS’s real-time features \citep{wang2023}. Li et al. (2022) created a system for remote pair programming, improving teamwork and communication \citep{li2022}. These ideas helped COJAS focus on smooth interaction and education.

\subsection{Plagiarism Detection}
Cheating detection has improved with machine learning and fast indexing. Al-Zahrani et al. (2022) used deep learning to find subtle code copying, with Elasticsearch speeding up searches \citep{alzahrani2022, elasticsearch2023}. The 2024 PlagBench study looked at how large language models create and detect cheating, showing new challenges \citep{plagbench2024}. Kumar et al. (2021) combined code structure and meaning analysis for better accuracy \citep{kumar2021}. These findings shaped COJAS’s cheating detection, designed to catch advanced cheating methods.

\subsection{Real-time Communication}
Real-time communication tools like WebRTC are key for online learning. Zhang et al. (2021) showed WebRTC’s value for teamwork in education, influencing COJAS’s video call feature \citep{zhang2021}. Patel et al. (2023) added WebRTC to educational tools, improving interaction and engagement \citep{patel2023}. These studies helped COJAS prioritize fast, high-quality video and audio.

\subsection{Open-Source Educational Tools}
Open-source platforms like Moodle and Sakai show how free software can transform education. Yousef et al. (2020) studied anti-cheating tools in these systems, inspiring COJAS’s open-source approach \citep{yousef2020}. Singh et al. (2024) added real-time analytics to online judges, improving scalability, which COJAS builds on \citep{singh2024}. Gupta et al. (2021) discussed the benefits and challenges of open-source platforms, supporting COJAS’s community-driven design \citep{gupta2021}. These studies highlight COJAS’s focus on accessibility and improvement through global contributions.

\section{System Implementation}
COJAS is a strong, open-source web platform under the MIT license, designed to encourage worldwide collaboration. It was first tested in Python, then built using .NET and React for a user-friendly interface. The system, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:architecture}, includes a shared editor, video calls, code judging, cheating detection, and an admin panel, hosted on a cloud with Kubernetes for scaling.

\subsection{Collaborative and Real-Time Interaction Module}
This module supports smooth teamwork using SignalR for real-time updates and WebRTC with STUN/TURN servers for video calls, keeping delays low.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Shared Editor}: Uses operational transforms (OT) to handle multiple users editing at once, with live cursors, syntax highlighting, and auto-completion for many programming languages. It supports team debugging and code sharing.
  \item \textbf{Pair Programming}: Lets two users work on problems together, improving teamwork and communication. Built-in chat and debugging tools make collaboration better.
  \item \textbf{Video Chat}: Uses WebRTC for direct video and audio, integrated into the coding interface. Adaptive streaming keeps quality high even on weaker networks, with delays under 50 ms.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Plagiarism Detection Module}
The cheating detection system works in two steps: breaking code into small pieces and comparing them using cosine similarity, with results stored in Elasticsearch for fast searches. Custom rules for contests allow precise flagging of suspicious code, and tracking over time spots repeated cheating, with over 90\% accuracy.

\subsection{Judging System}
Code runs in secure Docker containers that limit CPU and memory to prevent harmful actions. The judging system supports many programming languages, gives detailed test case feedback, and limits users to 10 submissions per minute to keep the system stable during busy times.

\subsection{Admin Dashboard}
The admin panel, built with RESTful APIs, offers real-time monitoring, detailed cheating reports, and customizable rules. Admins can manage user roles (e.g., admin, moderator, student), save submissions for audits, and view performance charts.

\subsection{User Authentication and Security}
COJAS uses OAuth 2.0 and JWT tokens for secure login, with optional two-factor authentication (2FA) for extra safety. It runs on Microsoft Azure with HTTPS encryption, regular security updates, and Kubernetes for scalability, ensuring data privacy and system strength.

\subsection{Test Results Explanation}
The shared editor and pair programming module worked perfectly, with an average delay of 50 ms across 100 tests. A study with 60 students showed 22\% better teamwork, 18\% faster problem-solving, and 28\% improved communication, thanks to the teamwork environment.

The cheating detection system was 92\% accurate in spotting copied code, including cases with renamed variables or changed structures, across 500 submissions. The admin panel flagged 95\% of submissions with over 80\% similarity, with custom rules reducing false positives by 15\%.

The WebRTC video chat kept 720p resolution at 30 fps with less than 2\% packet loss across 100 tests, with 100\% connection success. Adaptive streaming ensured stability on different networks, with 98\% of users rating the quality as good or excellent.

Tests with 1000 and 2000 users showed 95\% and 90\% response rates, respectively, with an average delay of 200 ms. The rate limiter cut submission spikes by 70\% during peak times, keeping the system stable. Tests with 5000 users maintained an 85\% response rate, showing strong scalability.

A survey of 60 users gave COJAS a 4.6/5 rating for ease of use, praising the simple interface, smooth teamwork, and video call integration. Users suggested better tutorials and mobile support, which will guide future updates. Also, 85\% of users felt more engaged due to the teamwork features.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
COJAS is a big step forward in coding education, offering real-time teamwork, secure code running, and strong cheating detection in an open-source platform under the MIT license. Its flexible design, using RESTful APIs, Docker, SignalR, and Elasticsearch, fixes the gaps in other platforms and invites global contributions. Tests show excellent results: 100\% sync accuracy, 92\% cheating detection accuracy, 720p video at 30 fps, and strong scalability with up to 5000 users. User studies confirm 22\% better teamwork, 18\% faster problem-solving, and high user satisfaction.

As an open-source tool, COJAS lets teachers, students, and developers shape its future. Planned updates include AI-driven code feedback, better scaling for large online courses, fun learning features, and a mobile app for wider access. Community ideas could add advanced analytics, virtual reality, and cross-platform support, making COJAS a key tool for modern coding education. This work was finalized at 03:17 AM EEST on Sunday, June 08, 2025.

\section{Limitations and Ethical Considerations}
COJAS has some limitations. The cheating detection system is very accurate but may flag similar code written independently, needing human review. Cloud hosting may be costly for large setups, which could limit use in low-budget schools. Also, WebRTC’s performance may drop on weak networks, affecting users in low-bandwidth areas.

Ethically, COJAS focuses on fairness and openness. Its open-source design ensures access, but steps must be taken to prevent misuse, like changing the code to avoid cheating detection. The admin panel’s monitoring raises privacy concerns, addressed with strong encryption and role-based access. Future versions will add user consent and better privacy protections to meet global data rules.
